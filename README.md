# Quantum Search Blog

The repository contains an example implementation of quantum search.
The code is described further in a blog post: [](https://softwaremill.com/a-busy-developers-guide-to-quantum-computing-part-1/).

## Quick Setup

1. Create and activate a Python virtual env:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt 
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Lab:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

4. Open the notebook in a browser:
   ```bash
   open http://localhost:8888/doc/tree/quantum_search.ipynb
   ```
   
5. To re-run the notebook, in the top menu select `Kernel` > `Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...`.
